# Travel Agency Webpage  

This is a simple travel agency webpage created as part of my [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coursework. The project follows specific HTML structure guidelines to practice semantic HTML, meta tags for SEO, and anchor elements with proper attributes.  

## Features  
- Proper HTML document structure with `DOCTYPE`, `lang`, and `meta` tags.  
- A **meta description** for SEO optimization.  
- Organized **headings (`h1`, `h2`)** to structure content.  
- A list of **travel packages** with clickable links.  
- A section showcasing **top itineraries** with images and descriptions.  
- All links open in a **new tab** (`target="_blank"`) and direct to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).  

##  File Structure  
- `index.html` → Main HTML file containing the structured webpage.  
- `README.md` → This file, explaining the project details.  

##  How to Use  
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Explore the travel packages and top itineraries.
